# Hospital Web Application

This is a hospital management web application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) with Vite for the frontend.

## Project Structure

- `/client` - React + Vite frontend
- `/backend` - Express.js API server

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
```
npm run install-all
```

2. Run both client and server in development mode:
```
npm run dev
```

3. To run just the client:
```
npm run client
```

4. To run just the server:
```
npm run server
```

## Frontend Technology

The frontend was migrated from Create React App to Vite for faster development and build times. Vite offers:

- Lightning-fast cold server start
- Instant hot module replacement (HMR)
- True on-demand compilation
- Optimized builds

## Backend Technology

The backend is built with Express.js and MongoDB for data storage.
